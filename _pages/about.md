I am Xiaopeng Xi, Post-doctoral researcher from Advanced Center for Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Valparaíso, Chile, under the guidance of Prof. Marcos Orchard. I had received my doctoral degree from the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China in 2020.
My research interests include condition monitoring, prognostics, nonlinear modeling and data analytics. I have presided over or participated in more than 10 national or provincial projects, such as National Natural Science Foundation of China for Young Scholars (PI), Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation for Young Scholars (PI), etc. The application scenarios contain blast furnace, high speed train, generator set, rotating machinery, control moment gyro, etc.
I had published more than 20 research papers on the topic of stochastic degradation modeling, health index analysis, and remaining useful life prediction, including the SCI papers in IEEE Transactions on Reliability, Mechanical Systems and Signal Processing, Science China Information Sciences, Quality and Reliability Engineering International, etc. I have been invited to deliver a keynote speech in the cutting-edge academic salon of Science China Information Sciences in 2020. I have 2 Chinese invention patents, and was awarded the second prize of Chinese Association of Automation (CAA) Natural Science Award in 2019. I am the referee of multiple international journals, such as IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, Reliability Engineering & System Safety, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, and IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica.
